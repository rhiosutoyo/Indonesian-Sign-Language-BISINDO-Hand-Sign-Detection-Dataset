## Data Collection: BISINDO Hand Sign
The dataset contains 20 photos for each character (i.e., A-Z). All the images were taken using a smartphone camera (i.e., Redmi Note 10 Pro) and processed using Python OpenCV. 
The same setting parameters are applied to all the photos (e.g., light intensity and distance). The total number of pictures in the dataset is 520 photos.

## Data Labeling
All photos are labeled using a Python package called [labelImg](https://pypi.org/project/labelImg/1.4.0/). 
Each photo has a label in the form of an XML file that contains information, such as the photoâ€™s directory, name, size, label, box coordinates, etc. 
The XML structure is shown below.

## Data Processing
The images are in the [collected images](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Research-Binus-BISINDO-DATASET/tree/master/collectedimages) folder. The dataset is separated into two groups, training, and testing, with a ratio of 4:1.
- [Training](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Research-Binus-BISINDO-DATASET/tree/master/train)
- [Testing](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Research-Binus-BISINDO-DATASET/tree/master/test)
